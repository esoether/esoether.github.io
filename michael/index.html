                            The Sun provides us with our central vital source of
                            energy. It represents the conscious self-hood of the
                            individual psyche – the power to do and to be. It
                            functions as the cloak our soul has chosen to
                            creatively actualize its purpose, and the heart and
                            core of beingness. This urge represented by the Sun
                            is the desire for full self-expression, for
                            manifesting personal power and talent in ways that
                            inspire others to express their creatively. This is
                            sometimes referred to as our yang energy, and it is
                            traditionally where we shine.</em

                        doom. A creation of the worst inside. The long
                        established, deeply ingrained consciousness of stark
                        limitation. Getting under it and destroying it the long

                            Also called the Ascendant (AC) for the sign that was
                            rising on the Eastern horizon specific to the time
                            and location of birth. Abstractly, these are soul
                            desires on a subjective level which operate as the
                            window or lens through which we see the world and
                            the instinctive mask we present as to the outside.
                            It is the filter through which everything we are
                            internally is projected into the external world and
                            through which everything in our outer environment is
                            personally interpreted by us. This is the lens
                            through which we filter our perspective on life and
                            also how others first see us or respond to us – how
                            we begin/start things. The AC also represents the
                            legacy available to us and the innate qualities that
                            have been the most fully developed and mastered
                            through numerous past life experiences – our

                        self-worth and substantiality of identity it came into

                        to be recognized and adored for its creative gifts and
                        undeniable warmth can result in vicious self-criticism
                        if others fail to provide it with the affection and

                        "The old past-centered facets of life are predominant in
                        this world. Those who take on the thought patterns of
                        this old earth find themselves immensely trapped in time
                        and space, and in physical form most of all. Yet in the
                        very midst of thinking and operating in this
                        rationalistic way, you are subtly and secretly fostering
                        a great wealth of New Earth consciousness, of fresh ways
                        of seeing. By relentlessly exposing yourself to the
                        rigors and consequences of the mentally-based world, you
                        come to that edge where the way to liberation becomes so
                        sharp that the deeper seeing comes up to give you space
                        and breath. It is quite a process to live between
                        cycles, bridge divergent worlds, and feel the necessity
                        of keeping it all going. But truly the soul is
                        witnessing each dangling moment, and preparing to go
                        free when the season is right and the prison doors open
                        of themselves, as the karma is completed and the unknown
                        calls you onward."<br />

                        "Two completely separate identities can be lived at
                        once. What is foremost is to be mentally prepared,
                        vigilantly watchful, and intent upon moving straight on
                        and not looking back. Your alter-ego, your double, your
                        nemesis, shadow, and friend is seeing life through the
                        rearview mirror, completely enwrapped in the
                        diametrically opposite world to the one consciously
                        pursued. The forefront-awareness sustains admirably and
                        avidly its directional instinct for which way is forward
                        from here. Your subconscious shadow-self is equally
                        devoted to seeing, knowing, and instrumenting the
                        backward gaze, the obstructive momentum. Living along
                        this edge hones the sensibility, clarifies things
                        immensely--if ever both ends are claimed, honored, and
                        given their due. It is a challenge and an adventure to
                        be rabidly dual, a karmic crossroads with immense
                        struggle and conflict and power. It contains a deep-down
                        gnawing hunger for resolution and reconciliation and
                        integration, so elusive, so unattainable, and yet so
                        needed and sought in the destiny-reckoning that refuses
                        to stay split, whatever it will take to fuse the bipolar
                        visions into unity."<br />

                        the reflection. Such gestures multiply. They gather
                        force and momentum. And soon we have fixed ideas about
                        what is pulling us back and what is carrying us forward.
                        Before you know it, you have become partisan, taking up
                        this side against this other side, swept up in the
                        drama. And you even become sure in your mind that whole

                        renounced completely. Yet you are making a

                        must come a point in the journey when the mind strips
                        away its disguise and you know once again that all is of
                        God, that all is toward the good, and nothing can ever

                        What is to be known is the inner essence of things. The
                        code, the extraordinary revelation, the realization is
                        there inherently in the very substance of existence. A
                        practiced eye can see inside, can penetrate and
                        illuminate. The schooling in perception comes between
                        lives and then overshadows each and every idea or notion
                        anybody can come up with. But to access and do honor to
                        this advanced faculty is rare. For seeing the whole
                        truth is excruciating to the ego-mind. And therefore the
                        battle is on to awaken to your innermost truth, or to
                        succeed brilliantly in adapting your truth to the
                        marketplace, selling your soul to the highest

                        "To delight in pursuit is never to get there, but to
                        enjoy the ride all the way. To identify with flight is
                        to run from what is dense and heavy and to deny the pain
                        of Earth. And to dream of a personal limitlessness is to
                        stay out of realities that bind. The longing and the
                        craving, the fantasy and the vision are everything here.
                        And as you perpetuate illusions you feel no pain.
                        Somewhere you are convinced that the very best thing is
                        to be free, and that to fall for linear progression is
                        to be a fool. Everything you know and follow is true in
                        worlds beyond, and false in the dense immediacy of Earth
                        experience."<br />
