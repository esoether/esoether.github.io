                            The Sun provides us with our central vital source of
                            energy. It represents the conscious self-hood of the
                            individual psyche – the power to do and to be. It
                            functions as the cloak our soul has chosen to
                            creatively actualize its purpose, and the heart and
                            core of beingness. This urge represented by the Sun
                            is the desire for full self-expression, for
                            manifesting personal power and talent in ways that
                            inspire others to express their creatively. This is
                            sometimes referred to as our yang energy, and it is
                            traditionally where we shine.</em

                        The Sun rules Leo, and there is no other sign in which
                        the solar light can shine quite as naturally. No heart
                        glows harder or brighter than this. Leo energy is regal
                        and dignified, proudly and grandly assuming dominion
                        over the marvelous magical creativity of life. With a
                        birthright to glory and unique personal access to inner
                        child, the generous lion rules over the heart. Because
                        of this, the Sun in Leo ferociously defends the innocent
                        and the vulnerable – any sort of injustice or betrayal
                        is a disgrace that has no place in its kingdom.

                        In the 7th House, the Leo Sun can feel that its light
                        only truly shines when it shares with others the
                        self-worth and substantiality of identity it came into
                        the world with. It strives to radiate a basis for
                        existence and to illuminate the path of selfhood for
                        others – to reveal to others the own light within them
                        by sharing its own heavenly light. The overwhelming need
                        to be recognized and adored for its creative gifts and
                        undeniable warmth can result in vicious self-criticism
                        if others fail to provide it with the affection and
                        reassurance it needs. Yet when provided with a deserved
                        doting partner who sees the value of its compassion, the
                        7th House Leo Sun's inner glow is restored and
                        recharged.

                        You put others center stage by encouraging them,
                        creating warmth and sunshine to gain the admiration and
                        attention you deserve. By acknowledging others'
                        uniqeueness, you are able to honor your own childlike
                        innocence and spontaneous vitality instead of acting in
                        needlessly dramatic or understated or overstated ways.
                        You gain vitality when involved in all manners of

                            The Moon acts as a reflector of our true selves
                            (Sun) and explains how we experience ourselves on a
                            less conscious level. Typically the governing
                            influence during childhood, the Moon manifests as
                            emotions, instincts, intuition, self-care, and
                            self-discovery. The Moon is what we need for
                            emotional satisfaction and also the process through
                            which we may separate ourselves emotionally from
                            other people, where issues of personal insecurity
                            may arise to be purified. This is sometimes referred
                            to as our yin energy.</em

                        With the moon in Leo, emotions are a relentless roller
                        coaster of highs and lows. Rain and sunshine at the same
                        time – an undeniable energetic force that commands the
                        stage. Everything is felt tenfold through the spotlight
                        lens of the heart, so dramatic performances and fiery
                        rampages become natural responses to demand attention
                        toward unmet needs. The lunar Moon in the solar light of
                        Leo can seem like a never-ending magic trick – the
                        aching desire to manifest miracles seemingly out of thin
                        air, the promise of the audience's applause driving you.
                        The real magic lies in the energy you can create from
                        your own inner applause once you acknowledge that your
                        personal magic is best channeled when you boldly support
                        yourself.

                        In the 7th House, the Leo Moon can feel as if it is not
                        allowed to admit it is struggling until it all becomes
                        too much. The sting of abandonment and betrayal has
                        conditioned the Leo Moon to meet the emotional needs of
                        loved ones while rejecting its own, and then exploding
                        at others or withdrawing completing when they criticize
                        you for not doing enough. The approval and praise from
                        others becomes like a drug you have always needed and
                        cannot survive without. As others draw away, the 7th
                        House Leo Moon pours more of itself into them, promising
                        its entire kingdom and pleading "Please don't go."

                        You can create the self-worth you need by noticing that
                        achieving admiration from others does not necessarily
                        result in success. The values projected may not be what
                        others want or need. The key is to relinquish the
                        position of director in your life drama and focus on
                        others' needs in a way that frees you to express your
                        flamboyant, generous nature. By uplifting others, you
                        find enjoyment and happiness and realize the fun and
                        loyalty that surrounds you.

                        "The little ego desires what it does not desire, needs
                        what it does not need. It goes after most avidly what it
                        later finds is so very different from what would be good
                        to have. But then things turn again and even the most
                        unconscious patterns reveal their redemptive glory. It
                        all depends on where you are along the spectrum: the
                        initial expansion, the inevitable contraction to follow,
                        or the tempered and seasoned expansion later. In the
                        middle point, it can be hell. But things start out so
                        amazingly and they end up as such a gold mine of
                        experience and self-understanding from all this. Much of
                        life is midstream and involves meeting shadows, enduring
                        reversals, and basically being forced to go absolutely
                        everywhere you never wanted to go. The reason it comes
                        out right in the end is that you move through all of it
                        and discover there is somebody in here who knows how to
                        do that and who remains unscarred, not even discouraged,
                        and is just waiting for the next opening to take up the
                        Earth's schooling in the way that fiery souls invite and
                        welcome, strangely enough."<br />

                            and location of birth. Abstractly, these are soul
                            desires on a subjective level which operate as the
                            window or lens through which we see the world and
                            the instinctive mask we present as to the outside.
                            It is the filter through which everything we are
                            internally is projected into the external world and
                            through which everything in our outer environment is
                            personally interpreted by us. This is the lens
                            through which we filter our perspective on life and
                            also how others first see us or respond to us – how
                            we begin/start things. The AC also represents the
                            legacy available to us and the innate qualities that
                            have been the most fully developed and mastered

                        building it constructs. It strives for a personal

                        boundaries and growing convinced that only wilderness

                        subconsciously restricted no matter the effort it puts

                            Mercury signifies our urge to express ourselves
                            verbally from the analytical left-side of the brain.
                            Mercury defines the nature of our mental talents and
                            intellectual approach but also the process by which
                            we may create endless mental worries and negative
                            expectations that lead to isolating and withholding
                            ourselves from true contact with others out of fear.
                            This planet correlates to the human need to give
                            order and linear structure to inherently phenomenal
                            reality and is the function by which we collect data
                            or organize the thoughts ignited by our internal and
                            external environments.

                        Mercury rules Virgo, so it is able to work its magic
                        especially well here. This is the placement of the
                        ultimate alchemist. The asleep fear of Merucy in Virgo
                        is indulging in the tendency to analyze and judge what
                        is right and wrong in yourself and others – creating
                        endless categories in your mind. This makes it difficult
                        to communicate in an orderly and confident way, and the
                        self-criticism can be suffocating.

                        When you are able to trust the universal, unseen order
                        of things, you stop feeling defensive about how actions
                        reflect imperfection. This allows you to develop
                        self-tolerance; you are then empowered to accomplish any
                        job with a sense of perfection but without applying the
                        same high standards of performance to your personal
                        life. By detaching from expecting perfection in your
                        relationships and communications with others, you can be
                        transformed to a new level.

                        In the 8th house, Mercury gives you a special ability to
                        perceive the motives of others that are hidden in their
                        communication. You speak in ways that utterly transform
                        other people, for good or for ill. The Mercury in the
                        8th mind operates like a psychic spy, covertly ripping
                        apart the layers of everything while revealing just
                        enough to forge deep connections with others. Even if
                        you seems disinterested or distracted, the unconscious
                        is scrutinising information at the speed of x-ray light.

                            self-discovery. The Moon is what we need for

                        self-worth and substantiality of identity it came into
                        the world with. It strives to radiate a basis for

                        "The mind profoundly divided between the supremely
                        constructive and upbuilding, and the radically
                        destructive and fragmenting. The intention is to gather
                        the best, to do the right thing, to be exemplary. But
                        somewhere along the line this energy runs out, and there
                        slips in its shadow which runs wild. Creating your own
                        troubles, cleaning up after yourself. Being at the mercy
                        of a fatal dualism that splits you terribly, the plight
                        and dilemma of one who has wandered into the territory
                        of tempting forces. Consciously blameless and innocuous;
                        subconsciously charged with mischief and mayhem. And the
                        hardest part is that it feels too late to turn this
                        around. As you experience the fatalistic notion that
                        this is just the way it is, you have arrived at the
                        center of the temptation, and must learn the art of

                        "Polarities go against each other in order to find each
                        other again. When they are still busy going against each
                        other, they pull you apart. And this experience is so
                        definitive, so intensive, and so traumatic that you
                        learn to bring the polarities back together any way you
                        can. The journey to make this possible is an extensive
                        one, because along the way you must mediate between
                        discrimination and release. You are walking a collective
                        karmic edge between the old and the new, in which both
                        of them must be honored in just the right ways. Yet the
                        work it takes to bring polarities together in fresh ways
                        is monumental. And that work is utterly redemptive, of
                        infinite meaning and scope, in opening doors and letting
                        totality in by conviction, by affinity, and by surrender

                            (Soul) in evolutionary astrology. It is said to
                            represent the core desires and deepest intention of
                            the Soul. This includes the desire to separate from
                            Source (individuality, becoming a distinct and
                            unique entity) as well as the desire to experience
                            cataclysmic evolutionary grown and return to the
                            source of creation.</em

                        The Sun rules Leo, and there is no other sign in which
                        the solar light can shine quite as naturally. No heart
                        glows harder or brighter than this. Leo energy is regal
                        and dignified, proudly and grandly assuming dominion
                        over the marvelous magical creativity of life. With a
                        birthright to glory and unique personal access to inner
                        child, the generous lion rules over the heart. Because
                        of this, the Sun in Leo ferociously defends the innocent
                        and the vulnerable – any sort of injustice or betrayal
                        is a disgrace that has no place in its kingdom.

                        In the 7th House, the Leo Sun can feel that its light
                        only truly shines when it shares with others the
                        self-worth and substantiality of identity it came into
                        the world with. It strives to radiate a basis for
                        existence and to illuminate the path of selfhood for
                        others – to reveal to others the own light within them
                        by sharing its own heavenly light. The overwhelming need
                        to be recognized and adored for its creative gifts and
                        undeniable warmth can result in vicious self-criticism
                        if others fail to provide it with the affection and
                        reassurance it needs. Yet when provided with a deserved
                        doting partner who sees the value of its compassion, the
                        7th House Leo Sun's inner glow is restored and
                        recharged.
