                        <em>
                          The Sun provides us with our central vital source of
                          energy. It represents the conscious self-hood of the
                          individual psyche â€“ the power to do and to be. It
                          functions as the cloak our soul has chosen to
                          creatively actualize its purpose, and the heart and
                          core of beingness. This urge represented by the Sun is
                          the desire for full self-expression, for manifesting
                          personal power and talent in ways that inspire others
                          to express their creatively. This is sometimes
                          referred to as our yang energy, and it is
                          traditionally where we shine.</em

                    <p>
                      Ruled by restrictive Saturn, Capricorn energy chisels its
                      paternal signature into the foundation of each building it
                      constructs. It strives for a personal standard of
                      excellence and grinds away with its eyes focused on the
                      long-game, knowing that hard work is non-negotiable under
                      the inescapable law of cause and effect. The mature
                      authoritarian writes the unyielding laws of time and space
                      itself, declaring the security in boundaries and growing
                      convinced that only wilderness lies beyond its walls â€” but
                      a heart guarded can be as lonely as a heart destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>The Sun</strong> in Capricorn can feel
                      subconsciously restricted no matter the effort it puts in.
                      The overwhelming reponsibility the outside world demands
                      is a heavy weight to bear â€“ a crushing weight that screams
                      its will never be perfect or solid enough for the
                      recognition and stability it seeks. Yet when provided with
                      the comfort of being alone and out of the spotlight, the
                      Sun in Capricorn is practical, responsible, and focused
                      enough to forge the path up any mountain it has resolved
                      to climb.

                      Eternal winter at its core, the world can often seem cold
                      and uniquely unforgiving, but a Capricorn Sun is a quiet
                      stone fortress in the midst of a snowstorm â€“ its
                      indestructible walls a buffer against the cruelest of
                      blizzards.

                          The Moon acts as a reflector of our true selves (Sun)
                          and explains how we experience ourselves on a less
                          conscious level. Typically the governing influence
                          during childhood, the Moon manifests as emotions,
                          instincts, intuition, self-care, and self-discovery.
                          The Moon is what we need for emotional satisfaction
                          and also the process through which we may separate
                          ourselves emotionally from other people, where issues
                          of personal insecurity may arise to be purified. This
                          is sometimes referred to as our yin energy.</em

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Unconscious Expression</h3>
                    <p>
                      Following the urge to appear perfect in the eyes of others
                      the Virgo Moon uses analytical powers to defend its
                      behavior when others question it. When others do not
                      behave according to the Moon in Virgo's expectations, it
                      may feel affronted and react with sarcasm or cold silence.
                      Indulging in a fear of criticism can lead to withholding
                      its helpful opinions and valuable perceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Often Virgo Moon may refuse to share its internal
                      reactions with a loved one and unwittingly create a secret
                      barrier. As a result, the moon sacrifices integrity in
                      order to be accepted, at least momentarily. This leads to
                      feeling guilty and not knowing why. Relating superficially
                      deprives others of the value of the Moon in Virgo's astute
                      perceptions and deprives it of the opportunity to feel
                      useful. In violating its own code, it undergoes severe
                      self-criticism, which in turn takes away the very security
                      it needs.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Conscious Expression</h3>
                    <p>
                      At its highest manifestion, Virgo Moon can communicate its
                      high standards in a way that confirms its own goodness and
                      perfection. When it lets go of its expectations of what
                      perfect behavior ought to look like (its own or the other
                      person's), the Moon in Virgo rids itself of ideas that
                      prevent closeness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As Virgo Moon empties its mind of the judgements that
                      cause separation, it experiences the joy and closeness in
                      communication it wants. It can do this by casting aside
                      the need to have others think of it as perfect. This frees
                      it to have faith in your intuition. Then the Moon in Virgo
                      can tell what, for itself, is the truth expressed as its
                      own point of view.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Past Lives</h3>
                    <p>
                      Past lives spent in positions of ministering to others,
                      healing them, taking care of their needs, and helping to
                      put them back together have resulted in a gentle humility
                      and the desire to serve. From lifetimes spent as artisans,
                      craftspeople, and physical healers, the Moon in Virgo has
                      concerned with the details of perfection in its work.
                      Thus, in this life a Virgo Moon has a tendency to feel
                      that all aspects of its behavior and performance must be
                      perfect before they can be allowed expression. This
                      attitude can interfere with the flow of charitable deeds
                      into the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a Virgo Moon, you are learning to express whatever
                      helpful detail you have at the moment, without having to
                      see the whole picture. When your piece of the puzzle has
                      been added, the larger vision becomes clearer for all
                      concerned. Then others can cooperate more easily with you
                      in attaining mutually beneficial results.

                          location of birth. Abstractly, these are soul desires
                          on a subjective level which operate as the window or
                          lens through which we see the world and the
                          instinctive mask we present as to the outside. It is
                          the filter through which everything we are internally
                          is projected into the external world and through which
                          everything in our outer environment is personally
                          interpreted by us. This is the lens through which we
                          filter our perspective on life and also how others
                          first see us or respond to us â€“ how we begin/start
                          things. The AC also represents the legacy available to
                          us and the innate qualities that have been the most
                          fully developed and mastered through numerous past
                          life experiences â€“ our inherited gifts.</em

                      With your window to the world (Ascendant/Rising) in
                      Capricorn, you interact with the external world in terms
                      of the things you want to accomplish and your belief that
                      respect and protocol need to be upheld in order for you to
                      maintain your sense of status and self-respect. You
                      express your inner being through your approach of quiet
                      integrity, common sense, and willingness to take
                      responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When looking outside yourself, you see the people and
                      situations around you in terms of whether or not you
                      respect their character and behavior, and offer you an
                      opportunity to advance toward your goals. You
                      <em>interpret</em> the behavior of others toward you in
                      terms of whether the person is showing appropriate respect
                      for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You expres your personality and attitude in ways that you
                      feel demonstrate prestige and authority. Your behavior and
                      demeanor show that you are respectful towards others, and
                      that you expect them to show you respect in return.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Your Achilles' Heel</h3>
                    <p>
                      You approach life from a position of wanting to achieve
                      results in the external world, and you have an innate
                      executive ability to organize and direct other people, and
                      yourself, in ways that allow goals to be achieved. This
                      can result in you seeing those who don't share this
                      primary value as too emotional or weak. Because you
                      sometimes think <em>others</em> are this way, it's easy
                      for you to assume that they could possibly view
                      <em>you</em> this way as well â€“ and it is your fear of
                      this potential disapproval that creates your Achilles'
                      heel.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Self-Actualization</h3>
                    <p>
                      You have special inborn abilities to achieve results in
                      the external world through your awareness of the structure
                      that is required in order to attain personal status and
                      prestige. Using these gifts increases your self-confidence
                      socially and opens the way to you experiencing ongoing
                      vitality in your life. Although it can be difficult to get
                      past your fear of how other people will see you and the
                      potential of their disapproval, the highest path is to be
                      courageous enough to overcome this obstacle and fully
                      express your true nature by allowing your willingness to
                      take personal responsibility for creating success to
                      inspire others to do the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then your greatest challenge becomes using the positive
                      <em>and</em> negative feedback from your environment to
                      shift and fine-tune the ways in which you express your
                      gifts and cultivate your ability to consistently create
                      positive results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When you actively use your natural gifts for establishing
                      authority and organizing on a level that appeals to the
                      public, then you will experience yourself as a powerful
                      cause in your own life rather than living in fear of
                      others' perceptions.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Past-Life Gifts</h3>
                    <p>
                      In many past lifetimes, your survival has depended on your
                      status, prestige, unquestionable integrity, and ability to
                      make sensible decisions. Many of these past incarnations
                      were spent in situations where you were in charge of
                      others as a political, business, or social leader. As a
                      result, you are innately aware of the importance of
                      reputation and taking responsibility for making sensible
                      decisions that lead to successful outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Lifetimes of having to postpone immediate pleasure in
                      order to reach long-term goals have given you a somewhat
                      austere, reserved, and serious demeanor, and a great sense
                      of self-discipline. At your best, you do not begrudge your
                      situation and instead look to see how to use current
                      circumstances to better your position from a position of
                      cautious pragmatism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      During these past lives, you have mastered the art of
                      taking charge of any situation in which you are involved,
                      and will make the personal sacrifices that are necessary
                      to reach your goals. Your talent for recognizing the
                      opportunities that present themselves, and your
                      willingness to take responsibility for using those
                      opportunities wisely, can teach us all the value of
                      stepping up to the plate and owning our ability to create
                      success in our own lives.

                      We experience a Saturn/Pluto conjunction on average every
                      34 years (meaning the last one was in November of 1982).
                      With Saturn (the Lord of Time and Karma) and Pluto (the
                      God of Power, Chaos, and Transformation) joining forces
                      together in the rigid, surefooted signed Capricorn, the
                      gravity can feel crushing.

                    <p>
                      With this happening in your first house, now is when you
                      will take control of how you assert yourself in this
                      world. It's time to tap into your determination, ambition,
                      methods, and habits, and recognizing what you may need to
                      change so that you can succeed. Anything that cannot stand
                      will crumble under this placement, and the upheaval
                      results in a purification that detoxifies the old ways.

                      your goals and inspire others.

                      Because your natal Neptune is at 23Â° Capricorn, this
                      restructuring and rebirth will involve how you identify
                      yourself on a spiritual or collective level. Dramatic
                      events and intense relationships lead to deep spiritual
                      transformation and a rapid evolution of spiritual
                      development. You may feel called to embark on a journey of
                      self-discovery to find a deeper meaning in life as your
                      hopes and dreams for the future undergo major
                      transformations. As you emerge from this long transit, you
                      will have earned a renewed determination and conviction to
                      turn your new dreams into reality.<br />

                      With your natal Uranus at 25Â° Capricorn involved, you may
                      feel pressured to make a profound change, but be careful
                      not to jump the gun by being impulsive. Remain flexible
                      and know that you are the revolution whether internally or
                      externally. You will likely receive creative and
                      revolutionary "downloads" that illuminate how you can
                      renew old structures by adapting them to the changes that
                      are manifesting externally.
