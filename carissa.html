                        <em>
                          The Sun provides us with our central vital source of
                          energy. It represents the conscious self-hood of the
                          individual psyche â€“ the power to do and to be. It
                          functions as the cloak our soul has chosen to
                          creatively actualize its purpose, and the heart and
                          core of beingness. This urge represented by the Sun is
                          the desire for full self-expression, for manifesting
                          personal power and talent in ways that inspire others
                          to express their creatively. This is sometimes
                          referred to as our yang energy, and it is
                          traditionally where we shine.</em

                      Ruled by expansive Jupiter, Sagittarian energy knows no
                      bounds when it comes to inspiring others with its broad,
                      optimistic viewpoints. It strives for the future and for
                      higher knowledge as it shoots its arrows at distant
                      targets â€“ reveling in possibility. The wandering
                      philosopher searches restlessly for space to contemplate
                      life's bigger questions, preaching that the journey itself
                      is often more of a reward than the destination â€“ but a
                      heart cloaked in buoyant moral righteousness can be as
                      ignorant as a heart that detests knowledge.

                      <strong>The Sun</strong> in Sagittarius can feel
                      subconsciously restless no matter what freedom and
                      adventures it experiences. The overwhelming need to be
                      recognized for its divine spontaneous wisdom and scholarly
                      search for the truth can result in an aversion to
                      committment â€“ an exaggerated voice that sticks its foot in
                      its mouth as it tries to secure the dogmatic moral
                      high-ground. Yet when provided with the freedom to stretch
                      its horizons, the Sun in Sagittarius is curious, playful,
                      idealistic, and inspired enough to gift everyone around
                      with a stroke of good fortune that allows each of us to
                      connect to our higher truths.

                      radiant warm truth of a sunny day outdoors â€“ its
                      long-reaching light a faithful beacon for all who find
                      themselves on the endless quest for meaning.

                          The Moon acts as a reflector of our true selves (Sun)
                          and explains how we experience ourselves on a less
                          conscious level. Typically the governing influence
                          during childhood, the Moon manifests as emotions,
                          instincts, intuition, self-care, and self-discovery.
                          The Moon is what we need for emotional satisfaction
                          and also the process through which we may separate
                          ourselves emotionally from other people, where issues
                          of personal insecurity may arise to be purified. This
                          is sometimes referred to as our yin energy.</em

                    <p>
                      The unconscious Moon in Taurus might habitually seek
                      others to provide attention, pampering, and love by
                      supplying material and sensual comforts. This dependency
                      can create an impression of personal inadequacy in order
                      to induce others to give the Moon their resources. By
                      projecting a helplessness in obtaining material goods, the
                      Moon in Taurus encourages others to furnish it with
                      comforts. Then it feels loved, secure, and worthwhile. But
                      in displaying an image of helplessness to others, the Moon
                      may also begin to believe it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Self-worth can feel undermined when others respond by
                      contributing to the unconscious Moon in Taurus'
                      sustenance, and the aid it receives from others reinforces
                      the belief that it lacks the energy or abilities to
                      provide its own support. When its emotional security
                      depends upon the material aid of others, it cannot be
                      creative or capable for fear that its comforts will be
                      taken away. Thus, it feels helpless and unable to actively
                      establish its material sense of worth.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Conscious Expression</h3>
                    <p>
                      At its highest manifestion, Taurus Moon can gain a deeper
                      sense of inner stability and self-worth by using its
                      personal resources to support and contribute to the
                      material stability of the environment. When it is able to
                      recognize that the people who feel good about themselves
                      are those who are contributing their talents and resources
                      in a tangible way, the Moon in Taurus is inspired to find
                      confidence in its ability to manifest and establish its
                      creativity
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As Taurus Moon recognizes that relying on others to create
                      its self-worth does not work, it frees itself to share its
                      own innate sense of security and grounded energy with
                      others so it can then experience the stability and luxury
                      it wants. It can do this by appreciating its own ideals
                      enough to manifest them. This frees it to create a surplus
                      of personal resources that provides patient deliberate
                      pleasure in the natural sensory world.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Past Lives</h3>
                    <p>
                      Past lives spent in positions of affluence, material
                      security, and comfort can cause a Taurus Moon to come into
                      this lifetime seeking material security above all else. It
                      associates having a strong financial base with emotional
                      stability and ease. Because it is accustomed to
                      accumulation, it can have a difficult time letting go of
                      anything, even things that are holding it back. This can
                      impede the flow of money coming into the Taurus Moon's
                      life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Due to past lives of physical sensitivity and indulgence,
                      the Moon in Taurus has strong physical desires for
                      sensuality, touching, and physical contact in this
                      incarnation. The Moon in Taurus is learning to accept the
                      natural healthiness of its needs and being open to having
                      them fulfilled â€“ becoming aware of the enrichment the
                      Universe offers it through other people. It is here to
                      learn to accept the idea of bargaining and discounts so it
                      can drop the assumption that it has to pay the full dollar
                      amount for everything it wants.

                      The first thing to let go of is counterproductive ideas:
                      the idea that you have a difficult time with money; the
                      idea that you have to earn every penny on your own and
                      that it's going to be a tough process; and the idea that
                      you have to do everything yourself, in exactly your way,
                      for your needs to be met.

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Key: Going with the Flow</h3>
                    <p>
                      The Moon in Taurus' lesson is to learn to trust the
                      universe. It can have such a strong fear of losing its
                      material security that it creates a poverty consciousness
                      in your life, feeling that resources are limited and that
                      it must be very careful about how it spends any of its
                      money, time, and possessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By focusing less on financial or material restrictions and
                      by simply being open to the universe blessing you with
                      prosperity, you can encourage your Taurus Moon to focus
                      less on worry and more on visualizing the universe pouring
                      blessings onto you which you receive with joyful
                      appreciation. In this way, you can open your Moon up to
                      receive the abundance it seeks at last. The challenge is
                      to be open to the joy of freely accepting resources from
                      other people and releasing the ego identification, not
                      feeling pressures that you have to do something in return.

                          Also called the Ascendant (AC) for the sign that was
                          rising on the Eastern horizon specific to the time and
                          location of birth. Abstractly, these are soul desires
                          on a subjective level which operate as the window or
                          lens through which we see the world and the
                          instinctive mask we present as to the outside. It is
                          the filter through which everything we are internally
                          is projected into the external world and through which
                          everything in our outer environment is personally
                          interpreted by us. This is the lens through which we
                          filter our perspective on life and also how others
                          first see us or respond to us â€“ how we begin/start
                          things. The AC also represents the legacy available to
                          us and the innate qualities that have been the most
                          fully developed and mastered through numerous past
                          life experiences â€“ our inherited gifts.</em

                      independent spirit will be valued and whether
                      opportunities for self-discovery exisit. You
                      <em>interpret</em> the behavior of others toward you in
                      terms of how well they acknowledge you as a unique and

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Your Achilles' Heel</h3>
                    <p>
                      Your natural approach to life is to express your innate
                      leadership abilities through your courage and your
                      assertive impulses. This can result in your seeing those
                      who <em>don't</em> approach life in this way as being
                      compromising and/or indecisive. Because you sometimes
                      think <em>others</em> are this way, it's easy for you to
                      assume that they could possibly view <em>you</em> this way
                      as well â€“ and it is your fear of this potential
                      disapproval that creates your Achilles' heel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you don't stay in touch with your own natural instincts
                      and instead allow this fear of how others might see you to
                      distract you from your own independent point of view, you
                      end up suppressing your assertive impulses and giving away
                      your power. Then you lose confidence in your innate sense
                      of courage and your ability to lead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For instance, you may refuse to take the initiative and
                      extend yourself to others â€“ fearing they might think you
                      are weak or needy. However, if you allow this to happen,
                      then instead of using the power of your inborn assertive
                      abilities constructively, you turn it inward against
                      yourself where it becomes a stubborn impediment. When all
                      that power is not outwardly expressed, it implodes and
                      blocks the flow of your own vital energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then others may in fact see you as indecisive, or as Mr.
                      or Ms. Nice, which can lead them to overstep their bounds
                      with you. If this happens, you may unexpectedly erupt into
                      anger, which can create an ongoing sense of animosity
                      between you. Then you may unconsciously use your sense of
                      independence in a brusque manner to keep others away â€“
                      this in turn leading to feelings of isolations.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Self-Actualization</h3>
                    <p>
                      You have special inborn abilities to achieve results in
                      vitality and self-confidence by motivating and inspiring
                      others through your willingness to act on the
                      impulsiveness of your own bold spirit â€“ exploring
                      innovative ideas and emboldening others to take a chance
                      on something new! Using your gifts for pioneering and
                      courageous leadership increases your self-confidence
                      socially and opens the way to you experiencing ongoing
                      vitality in your life. Although it can be difficult to get
                      past your fear of how other people will see you and the
                      potential of their disapproval, the highest path is to be
                      courageous enough to overcome this obstacle and fully
                      express your true nature by allowing your willingness to
                      be independent and your gift of asserting yourself to
                      carry you to a position where you can free others to do
                      the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then your greatest challenge becomes using the positive
                      <em>and</em> negative feedback from your environment to
                      shift and fine-tune the ways in which you express your
                      gifts and cultivate your ability to consistently create
                      positive results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When you actively use your natural gifts for being direct
                      and authentic in your presentation on a level that
                      invigorates those around you, then you will experience
                      yourself as a powerful cause in your own life rather than
                      living in fear of others' perceptions.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Past-Life Gifts</h3>
                    <p>
                      In many past lifetimes, your survival has depended on
                      solely on your own instincts and actions. Many of these
                      past incarnations were as a warrior â€“ embracing courage
                      and self-reliance as the most important values. As a
                      result, you are innately aware of the importance of
                      bravery and approaching the battlefield of life with the
                      confidence to overcome any obstacle through your
                      willingness to fight for what you feel is right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Lifetimes of having to actively fight to reach long-term
                      goals has given you a somewhat argumentative,
                      straightforward, childlike, and explosive demeanor, but
                      also a great sense of self and innocence. At your best,
                      you do not angrily attack those who disagree with you but
                      instead look to see how you can use current circumstances
                      to "lead the charge" and serve the higher cause you
                      believe in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      During these past lives, you have mastered the art of
                      taking charge of any competition in which you are
                      involved, and expressing yourself passionately in
                      disagreements â€“ especially when it comes to authority
                      figures. Your talent for fighting valiantly for the
                      underdog as an underdog yourself, and your willingness to
                      stand up for all who cannot stand up for themselves,
                      teaches us all the value of stepping up to the plate and
                      owning our ability to be valiant warriors in our own
